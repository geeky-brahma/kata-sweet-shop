# Sweet Shop Management System

A full-stack application for managing a sweet shop inventory and sales, built with React (Frontend) and Node.js/Express (Backend).

## Setup Instructions

### Backend
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend
1.  Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Features
-   **User Authentication**: Register and Login (JWT-based).
-   **Sweet Inventory**: View sweets, search by name/category.
-   **Purchasing**: Users can purchase sweets (stock decreases).
-   **Admin Dashboard**:
    -   Add new sweets.
    -   Restock sweets.
    -   Delete sweets.
    -   Protected by role-based access.

## Testing
To run the backend test suite (TDD verification):
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

## My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used
-   **Antigravity (Google DeepMind)**: Used as the primary coding assistant for planning, scaffolding, and implementing the entire codebase.

### Application
-   **Project Structure**: I used AI to generate the folder structure and initial boilerplate for both Express and React applications.
-   **TDD**: The backend logic was implemented using a Test-Driven Development approach where the AI wrote the tests first (integration tests with Supertest) and then the implementation code.
-   **Logic & Design**: I leveraged AI to design the database schema (Sequelize models) and the frontend component hierarchy. The CSS styling was also generated to ensure a clean, modern aesthetic.

### Reflection
Using AI significantly speeded up the "boilerplate" phase, allowing me to focus on the business logic (inventory management, auth flow). It successfully handled the context switching between Backend and Frontend. The Co-author trailers in commits reflect the AI's contribution.
